.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.br
echo "command" | 
.B hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that executes commands read from standard input. It implements basic shell functionality including command execution, PATH resolution, and signal handling.

The shell operates in both interactive and non-interactive modes:

.TP
.B Interactive Mode
When running with a terminal, the shell displays a prompt ($ ) and waits for user input.

.TP
.B Non-Interactive Mode
When receiving input through a pipe, the shell executes commands without displaying a prompt.

.SS Command Execution
Commands are searched for in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable. If a command is not found in PATH, an error message is displayed.

.SS Built-in Commands
.TP
.B exit [status]
Exit the shell with optional numeric status. If no status is provided, uses the last command's exit status.

.SS Signal Handling
The shell handles Ctrl+C (SIGINT) by displaying a new prompt instead of terminating.

.SH OPTIONS
The shell does not support any command-line options.
