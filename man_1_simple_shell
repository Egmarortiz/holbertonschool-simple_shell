.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a simple command line interpreter that reads commands from standard input and executes them. It can be used in both interactive and non-interactive modes.
.PP
When used interactively, it displays a prompt ($) and awaits user input. When used non-interactively, it reads commands from standard input without displaying a prompt.
.PP
The shell handles command lines with arguments and implements the PATH lookup for executables. It also implements built-in commands and proper handling of the end-of-file condition (Ctrl+D).
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit [status]
Exit the shell with an optional status code. If no status is provided, the shell exits with the status of the last executed command.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
Commands are executed by following these steps:
.PP
1. The shell splits the command line into words using spaces and tabs as delimiters.
.PP
2. If the first word of the command is "exit" or "env", the corresponding built-in command is executed.
.PP
3. Otherwise, the shell searches for the command in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
.PP
4. If the command is found, the shell creates a child process and executes the command with the provided arguments.
.PP
5. If the command is not found, an error message is displayed, and the shell returns a status code of 127.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell uses the following environment variables:
.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories used to search for executable commands.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell returns the exit status of the last command executed, or 0 if no command was executed.
.PP
If a command is not found, the shell returns 127.
.PP
If a command is found but cannot be executed, the shell returns 126.
