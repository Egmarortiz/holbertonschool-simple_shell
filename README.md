Built for the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum.

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project implements a simplified shell, named `hsh`, capable of executing UNIX commands in both **interactive** and **non-interactive** modes. It mimics the behavior of classic shells like `sh` or `bash` using system calls like `fork`, `execve`, and `waitpid`.
